# Linear Structures
Data collections whose items are ordered depending on how they are added or removed.
## Stacks
Ordered collection of items where the addition of new items or removal of existing items takes place at the same end (LIFO).
## Queues
Ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items take place at different ends (FIFO).
## Dequeue
Similar to the queue, it has two ends, and the items remain positioned in the collection. What makes a dequeue different is the unrestrictive nature of adding and removing items.
## Linked List
A collection of Nodes that point to the next one is a linked list.
### Unordered list
Items are added at the top of the list.
### Ordered List
Provided that all items are numbers, a new item is added in the correct order.
