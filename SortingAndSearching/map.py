Implementing the Map Abstract Data Type.

One of the most useful Python collections is the dictionary,
an associative data type where you can store key-data pairs.

The keys in a map are all unique so that there is a one-to-one relationship
between a key and a value. The key is used to look up the associated value,
an idea often referred to as map.
